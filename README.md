# vim-config
This is the home of my Vim config. I have already created a NeoVim one, so I thought this would be fun!

Before we begin, this is for a Mac (UNIX) setup, so this may not work one-2-one with Windows machines because of pathnames...

First, you must go to the `~` directory and create a directory called `.vim` and create a file called `.vimrc`
