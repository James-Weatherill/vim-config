# vim-config üò∂‚Äçüå´Ô∏è
This is the home of my Vim config. I have already created a NeoVim one, so I thought this would be fun!

Before we begin, this is for a Mac (UNIX) setup, so this may not work one-to-one with Windows machines because of pathnames...

1. The first step is to go to the `~/` directory and create another directory called `.vim/`.

2. Now, also in the `~/` directory, create a file called `.vimrc`.

3. Now that that is all setup, download and move the files in this repository into the `~/.vim/` directory, and run the command below:
```
curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim
```

This will install the Vim-Plug plugin manager into the local Vim setup.

4. All of the files and directories are now in place make Vim look exactly like it should. The last big step is to go to the `~/.vimrc` file and paste all of this vimscript code into that file:
```
" This file contains the main code that supports 'vim-plug'.

source ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim


" This is where I install all of my plugins, and thus, must sit at the top of this page.

source ~/.vim/runtime/my-plugins.vim


" This is the config file for my 'coc' setup, which gives me all the keybindings.

source ~/.vim/runtime/coc-settings.json


" This file contains all of my personal keybindings that I use.

source ~/.vim/runtime/keybindings.vim


" This is the bulk of my Vim settings, where everything comes together.

source ~/.vim/runtime/settings.vim
```

This will source all of the files that are in the `~/.vim/runtime/` directory.

5. After that, the only remaining thing is to open up an empty Vim file using the `vim` command in the terminal and run: `:PlugInstall`.

Now, the Vim config is complete, and everything is in place, just install the 'coc' lsp's as and when they are needed.
